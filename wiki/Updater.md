# Updater

### This technology will allow you to download all available versions of a project without going to your browser!

### Now you always have access to the latest version of the project!

---

# How to use

You can update the program to the latest version by calling it with the command line argument ```--update```:

### Update when a binary file is available
![Windows](https://github.com/rzc0d3r/ESET-KeyGen/blob/main/img/updater_binary_update.png)

### Update when no binary file is available
![Windows](https://github.com/rzc0d3r/ESET-KeyGen/blob/main/img/updater_src_update.png)

Then the program itself will find the latest version and load it into the project folder.

> The upgrade program doesn't replace the files itself, because it's all in your hands!!!

> You can just copy the new folder or binary file to the right place and delete the old one!!!

### Also added to all this is the ```--skip-update-check``` command line argument, which disables checking for updates when you start the program
#### Without this argument, the program will always notify you when an update is available

# NOTES
1. If you see an **[ ERROR ] Your IP address has been blocked. try again later or use a VPN!**, you have run the program very often. If you don't want to update yet use the ```--skip-update-check``` argument. This way you will disable this error!
2. If you are using a system not supported by the project. The updater will always download the source code (You use it anyway, since there are no binaries for your system **:)** )
3. Also, the command line argument ```--update``` disables all other arguments. So just running the project with one ```--update``` argument will be enough for the update!
